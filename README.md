## Introduction

Thank you for joining me for my Bellabeat Data Analysis Capstone Case Study. I have recently been progressing through the Google Data Analytics Certificate and as part of my course I created a Case Study in order to answer some business questions for the stakeholders at Bellabeat. I will be using the standard steps of Data Analysis: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
